# AirBattle
This is my first attempt at making a game. As a C++ beginner, I spent the entire summer vacation debugging and finally finished this rough game on Visual Studio 2022. Many resources came from the internet, and there are also some AI-generated images and a simple song with repeating chords that I composed. Hope you like it. :) ---Aug 28th,2024

For those who wanna run the code:
ATTENTION! The file named "res" must be placed in the same folder as the code to avoid errors, in that the code calls resources through relative paths.
For those who just wanna play the game:
What ya need to do is downloading and uncompressing the 7z file named "AirBattleInstaller", after which you'll get an installer and then just follow the steps.
