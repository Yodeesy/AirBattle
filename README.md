a simple 2D game
This is my first attempt at making a game. As a C++ beginner, I spent the entire summer vacation debugging and finally finished this rough game on Visual Studio 2022. Many resources came from the internet, and there are also some AI-generated images and a simple song with repeating chords that I composed. Hope you like it. :) ---Aug 28th,2024
